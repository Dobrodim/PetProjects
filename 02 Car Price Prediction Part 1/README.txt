07 PROJECT 'Car Price Prediction Part 1'
Date of completion - June 2021

The goal of the project is to predict the cost of used cars using data from the website www.auto.ru

I did an in-depth analysis of the data, cleaned it up and removed the least valuable features. After that, I built several machine learning models - from the naive model to the classic gradient boosting and CatBoost. Finally, I made an ensemble of models.
