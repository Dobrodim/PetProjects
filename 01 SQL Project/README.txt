01 PROJECT 'SQL / Analysis of flights to Anapa city'
Date of completion - February 2021

We have a dataset with Russian flights for 2017 and 2018. We had to analyze the direction to Anapa in the winter and then give recommendations on how to optimize the entire direction at this time of the year.

The queries file - SQL queries are written to extract data from DB from simple to complex.
Flights_optimization file is a generated flight optimization proposal.

P.S. I've used the MySQL DBMS for this project.
