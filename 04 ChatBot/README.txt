04 PROJECT 'ChatBot'
Date of completion - April 2022

The goal of the project is to develop a chatbot with the following logic:
- the input algorithm receives a request from the user,
- if the request is identified as a product one, then the bot gives the product ID that matches the request,
- in other cases, the bot goes into a branch with a chat room.

The project based on Word2Vec.
