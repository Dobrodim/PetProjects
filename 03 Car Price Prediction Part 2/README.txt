03 PROJECT 'Car Price Prediction Part 2'
Date of completion - August 2021

The goal of the project is to predict the cost of used cars.

In the second part, special emphasis was placed on machine learning.

1. First, I trained a simple neural network on tabular data.

2. Then I trained the neural network on tabular data and text. In this block, I worked with the text feature "description" - cleared it of symbols, removed stop words and made lemmatization.

3. Then I trained an extensive neural network on tabular, text and image data. In this block, I did image augmentation. The network took a long time to train - you can find a complete display of the results in my notebook on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/dobrodim/car-price-prediction-part-2-dobrodim/notebook#Total

4. Finally, I combined the results of the final model with neural networks and CatBoost. In combination, the best result is obtained.
